# Web Vulnerability Scanner

## Overview

The Web Vulnerability Scanner is a comprehensive tool designed to identify various vulnerabilities in web applications. It includes scanners for common vulnerabilities such as Cross-Site Scripting (XSS), SQL Injection, Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF), SSL/TLS configuration issues, and security header misconfigurations.

## Features

- **XSS Scanner**: Detects potential Cross-Site Scripting vulnerabilities.
- **SQL Injection Scanner**: Identifies SQL injection vulnerabilities.
- **CSRF Scanner**: Checks for Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerabilities.
- **SSL Scanner**: Evaluates the SSL/TLS configuration of the target application.
- **Header Scanner**: Analyzes security headers and their configurations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/web-vulnerability-scanner.git
   cd web-vulnerability-scanner
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

## Usage

To run the vulnerability scanner, execute the following command:
